A rules document states what tiles the prorgam should load and their properties

It begins with a list of all the tile names, for instance:
up,down,left,right...etc

Then continues with a new line for each tile in the format "rule,image,name,u,r,d,l"

image: the name of the image to be loaded e.g. "UP.png"
name: the name of the tile taken from the already input tile names list
then which side type it is for up,right,down and left respectively

You can also add lines for a rotation of an already made tile in the format "rotation,index,name,rot"
rotation: state that you are creating a tile that is a rotation of a predefined tile
index: the index of the tile that is to be rotated based on the order the tiles are created (starting from 0)
