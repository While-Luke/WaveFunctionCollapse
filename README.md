# WaveFunctionCollapse

I found the idea through the Coding Train: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI_y2GAlQFM
I believe the idea comes from this GitHub page: https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse

My program reads in the tilesets from each file using the rules.txt document. The format and use of these documents is described in the RuleExplained.txt document. Different files/tilesets can be chosen through changing one of the top variables of the main program.
